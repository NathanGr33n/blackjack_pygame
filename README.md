## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture & Code Organization
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean separation with `Card`, `Deck`, and central `Game` classes that handle deck management, player and dealer hands, chip tracking, and UI elements
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of game logic, rendering, and user input
- **Modular Structure**: Separate files for core gameplay (`main.py`) and card logic (`deck.py`)
- **Strategy System**: Optional basic strategy hints with `basic_strategy.py` module

### Graphics & Rendering
- **Pygame Engine**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
- **Custom Drawing Functions**: Card borders, shadows, and visual effects
- **Image Scaling**: Dynamic resizing for consistent card display (80x120px)
- **Animation System**: Sine wave-based chip stack bouncing effects
- **UI Elements**: Button highlighting and interactive feedback

### Game Logic Implementation
- **Authentic Blackjack Rules**: Standard casino rules with proper hand evaluation
- **Intelligent Ace Handling**: Automatic high/low value adjustment (11 ‚Üí 1)
- **Dealer AI**: Follows standard casino rules (hit on ‚â§16, stand on ‚â•17)
- **Deck Management**: Proper shuffling, no card repetition until deck reset
- **State Transitions**: Clean round management and betting phases
- **Strategy Hints**: Optional basic strategy recommendations

### Data Management
- **Statistics Tracking**: Real-time win/loss/push/bust counters
- **Export Functionality**: JSON and TXT format statistics export
- **Game State Persistence**: Maintains chip count between rounds
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing assets and edge cases

### Performance Features
- **Efficient Rendering**: Only updates necessary screen regions
- **Memory Management**: Minimal RAM usage (< 50MB)
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No module named 'pygame'"**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pygame
```

**"Error loading PNG"**
- Ensure the `assets/` folder is in the same directory as `main.py`
- Verify all card images are present in `assets/cards/png/`

**Game runs slowly or choppy**
- Update your graphics drivers
- Close other graphics-intensive applications
- Try running on a different display if using multiple monitors

**Statistics not exporting**
- Check write permissions in the game directory
- Ensure the game directory is not read-only

### System-Specific Notes

**macOS**: You may need to install pygame using:
```bash
python3 -m pip install pygame
python3 main.py
```

**Linux**: Install required dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
# or
pip3 install pygame
```
